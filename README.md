# Liquid-Gas-Simulation-in-ConfinedSystems
LAMMPS files of 2D complex plasmas with Kompaneets interaction and 3D colloidal systems in a gravity field are included.
File Komp_zetal0d18.table contains the interaction data of Kompaneets potential with \zeta_l=0.18, \tau_l=0.
"KompN....lj" means this file is the LAMMPS code of 2D complex plasma simulation with Kompaneets potential. The temperature may need to be reset.
"YukawaN....lj" means this file is the LAMMPS code of 2D complex plasma simulation with Yukawa interaction.
"Colloidal_AO_....lj" is the LAMMPS code of 3D colloidal systems with AO interaction in a gravity field.
"Colloidal_NoAttraction" is the LAMMPS code of 3D colloidal systems without attraction in a gravity field.
